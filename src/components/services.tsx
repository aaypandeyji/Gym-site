                A proven workplace wellness programs to improve employee motivation, dedication, and productivity. Employees are the key to an organization’s success. Studies indicate, organizations around the world grapple to deal with performance lows brought on by employees’ drop in performance. Of the factors identified for these performance drops, lack of wellness has been identified as the leading causative factor. Lethargic employees, unwell employees, absent employees – what every organization around the world would dread to begin its day with. We’re all too familiar with employees who walk in with common cold afflictions, back pain or just the lack of energy even at the beginning of the day. Alternatively, consider the executives who look at you with a blank expression in an all-important meeting. Wellness is an optimal state of three elements: mind, body, and spirit. In this state, an individual is primed to give his or her best in every sphere of life.
